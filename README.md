A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

June, 2022
By Vinayak and Sandeep

With inputs from Prof. V Sridhar 

# 1)	Introduction

India has been often referred as the capital of internet shutdown with having more than 500 complete shutdowns from 2013-21. The highest number being noted in the recent year 2020 itself when number of shutdowns reached 129 as per a report by (https://internetshutdowns.in). Some of the common shutdown in our recent memories include during the protests against the government in Kashmir, growing foreign propaganda during Farmers Protest, maintain peace during violence in the West Bengal Elections (Newslaundry,2021). 

1.1	What is Internet Shutdown

According to Access now 2018, “An internet shutdown is an intentional disruption of Internet-based communications, rendering them inaccessible or effectively unavailable, for a specific population, location, or mode of access, often to exert control over the flow of information.” 

1.3	Gaps in existing regulation

Through analysis of secondary Data sources (Suspension of Telecom Services/Internet and Its impact, standing committee on C&IT 2021-22) and other sources, following gaps are identified in the present regulations governing Internet shutdown in India:
•	No public consultation before enacting the Internet Shutdown law 2017
•	Definition of Inevitable circumstance - clear definition of conditions in which Internet Shutdown can be imposed by the state
•	Process of Review and power to reverse shutdown - No clear definition of process to be followed by review committee before and after imposing the internet shutdown
•	Review period - No rationale of fixing review within 5 days of imposing shutdown
•	Composition of Review committee - Non-inclusion of non-executive members in the review committee (Review is done by officials which are working under the same government).
•	Redressal mechanism - No redressal mechanism to challenge internet shutdown
•	Monetary compensation - No compensation for economic, social and psychological loss (TISP, Consumer, Platforms, startups etc.)

# 2)	Why is Regulatory Intervention needed in the Context of Internet Shutdown?

•	Address a significant market failure - Negative externalities of Internet shutdown, information Asymmetry due to internet shutdown
•	Promote certain features of a market - universal access of information is hampered due to internet shutdown
•	Economic considerations - low consumer surplus, low producer surplus
•	Freedom of Speech considerations

# 3)	Approach of Regulatory Impact Analysis (StakeHolders)

3.1	Identification of the parties having economic impacts due to internet shutdown

•	Citizens (Infotainment, Education, Health etc.)
•	TISP (Telecom & Internet Service Providers)
•	E- Businesses (Press, OTT Services, e-Commerce platforms etc, eduTech, HealthTech, Startups etc.)
•	State

3.2	Identification of independent variables leading to economic impacts

•	Time of internet shutdown (Hours/Days)
•	Cost of internet data (perGB/prepaid/postpaid)
•	Number of Internet subscribers who are affected
•	Geography of internet shutdown (Location/state) - per capita income
•	Average data consumption per user in the location/state
•	Digital financial transactions in the state

3.3	Benefit Cost Analysis

3.3.1	Risk of maintaining the existing Internet shutdown regulation (Benefit to change the regulation):

•	TISP and business keep bearing the loss. In absence of monetary compensation, the firms won’t be able to recover the Average Variable cost (in the short run) and Average Total cost (in the long run will) and shutdown their business. To sustain, they will increase the internet/product cost. This will affect the consumer as they have to pay more for internet access. Consumer surplus will be very low.
•	Consumer and producer surplus will increase

3.3.2	Risk of changing the existing Internet shutdown regulation (Cost to change the regulation):

•	State has to compensate the TISP and business for the loss incurred due to the state-imposed internet shutdown. This will affect the state exchequers. State will try to recover this expenditure through extra tax etc.
•	States can compensate the TSPs by reducing the levy on their revenue, by reducing the tax on e-commerce firms, by reducing financial transaction charges for financial institutions etc.

# 4)	Data Analysis

As per Top10VPN report[2], there were a total of 8927 hours of IS in India in 2020 and it has affected a total of 10.3 million population. This is taken as the basis for our calculation of economic impact.
The 10 states selected for our analysis are as follows:
1.	Jammu and Kashmir
2.	Maharashtra
3.	West Bengal
4.	Andhra Pradesh
5.	Madhya Pradesh
6.	Uttar Pradesh
7.	Meghalaya
8.	Manipur
9.	Rajasthan
10.	Arunachal Pradesh


4.1	Datasets


# 5)	Calculating Economic Impact

5.1	Telco Dataset

Objective - To calculate the economic loss (revenue) to Telecom Service Providers due to Internet Shutdown.

Assumption - Revenue loss due to wireless internet services (3G/4G) only considered. Fixed line broadband is not considered. Only revenue loss is calculated. Net loss is not calculated.

Input Variables - Given the following variables from the dataset:
1.	No Internet users in the affected state
2.	Average Data usage per user per month (in GigaBytes - GB) for the country
3.	Average Wireless Data revenue realization per GB for the country

Output:

1.	Total Revenue realization by TSP per Hour (in Rs) in 2020 in each affected state
2.	Total Revenue Loss to TSP in affected states due to Internet Shutdown in 2020

Calculation: 

1.	Total data usage per month in 10 states in 2020 = 
2.	Total Data Usage per Hour (GB) in 10 states in 2020 = 
3.	Total Revenue realization per Hour (in Rs) in 2020 = 
4.	Total Revenue Loss to TSP in affected states due to Internet Shutdown in 2020 = 

5.2	dComm Dataset - Digital Commerce

Objective - To calculate the economic loss (revenue) to Digital Platforms due to Internet shutdown.

Assumption - Majority of digital platforms and brick and mortar outlets provide PhonePe option for paying for goods and services. PhonePe is the market leader for digital financial transactions with pan India coverage. The volume and value of transactions on PhonePe reflects economic activities of digital platforms. The offline transactions such as Cash on delivery and direct cash transaction at outlets are not considered in the calculation. Only revenue loss is calculated. Net loss is not calculated.

Input variables: 

Given the following variables from the dataset:
1.	No Transaction Per Hour in 2020
2.	Value of The Transaction Per Hour (Rs) in 2020

Output: 

1.	Total value of Digital Transaction Per Hour in affected States in 2020
2.	Total Revenue Loss to Digital Commerce in affected states due to Internet Shutdown in 2020 

Calculations:

1.	Total value of Digital Transaction Per Hour in affected States in 2020 = 
2.	Total Revenue Loss to Digital Commerce in affected states due to Internet Shutdown in 2020 = 

5.3	State GDP Data from RBI

Objective: To calculate the economic loss (net) to state GDP due to Internet Shutdown.

Assumption: State GDP is the cumulation of multiple factors representing the formal and informal sectors and activities. In our calculation, we have considered the contribution of the Digital economy on state GDP. The contribution of the Digital economy on the country's GDP was 7.7% in 2020.

Input variables: 

Given the following variables from the dataset:
1.	State GDP per capita in Rs in 2020
2.	State Population in 2020

Output:

1.	Total state GDP Per Hour in affected States in 2020
2.	Total Net GDP loss due to Internet Shutdown in 2020 

Calculation:

1.	Total state GDP Per Hour in affected States in 2020 = 
2.	Total Net GDP loss due to Internet Shutdown in 2020 = 


# 6)	Conclusion -

The analysis shows an approximate USD 2.75 Billion revenue loss to Telecom and digital businesses due to Internet shutdown in 2020. It also shows a net USD 1.25 Billion loss to national GDP in 2020 due to the Internet shutdown. The Internet shutdown is a state matter associated with law and order, integrity and public safety. There is a significant economic impact of such shutdowns as shown by our analysis and hence Government should formulate policies to provide economic compensation due to state-imposed shutdowns in the form of reduced levies and taxes.
